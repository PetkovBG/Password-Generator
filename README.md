#### In the example below we have a password that has a length of 12, it includes uppercase characters, numbers and special characters. This is because the user selected number of characters to be 12 and the user selected all 3 optional fields for uppercase letters, numbers and symbols.

### The tool works if only one or any given number of of the optional fields is selected. The example below is with selected length of 10 and include numbers box selected

#### The number of characters field does not allow the user to go below 1 so it always generates a password when the Generate Password button is selected
